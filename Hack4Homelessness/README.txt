This is the code snippet written for the hackathon Hack4Homelessness.

The script takes selection criteria and outputs a list of listing ids that are NGOs can contact to negotiate discounted accommodation (temporary) for homeless people / roughsleepers.

The script "api.py" was written by GitHub user nderkach and can be found on:

Also included is some work-in-progress to use the Domain api. PLan was abandoned after confirming Domain did not have data needed for business model.
